# Quaternion
Simulation of upper limb movement through the use of quaternions

The growth of strokes in Brazil has brought an increase in the demand for rehabilitation of 
members affected by this disease since it is one of the main causes of death in the world. Thus, the 
objective of this code is to develop an inertial tracking system for recognizing compensatory 
movements during the implementation of the virtual reality game in the rehabilitation of upper limbs 
of patients with post-stroke trauma.

The .csv file represents the movement quaternions generated by the "quaternions" code, which are read and simulated by the "ReadData" code
